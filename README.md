A repository to document my Python learning journey

About Me
Hi there! My name is Taimin (Eric) Zhou. I'm a passionate learner with a strong interest in exploring Python, particularly its data structures. I think that mastering data structures is important in becoming a programmer, and I'm really excited to document my journey and share my knowledge through this repo.

Goals
This repository will be a collection of notes, code, and projects (midterm and final) as I work through advanced Python concepts with a focus on data structures. 

1) Deepen my understanding of Python data structures - I'll be arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs, and more.
2) Understand how data structures work under the hood by implementing them manually in Python.
3) Apply data structures to solve real-world problems and improve problem-solving skills.

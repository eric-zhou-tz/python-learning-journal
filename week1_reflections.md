Reflections on My Python Journey
So far in my Python journey, I've had the opportunity explore computer vision and competitive programming 
through USACO. 

These experiences have taught me a lot about the power and versatility of Python:

Computer Vision: I've into used image processing and manipulation, 
and learned how to use models like YOLOv9, MMdetecion etc. to perform tasks such as image recognition,
object detection, and more. Because of this, I see the potential of Python in real-world applications, 
especially in AI and machine learning.

USACO: Competing in USACO has taught me tosolve complex problems efficiently. 
It's has pushed me to write optimized code and deepened my understanding of algorithms.

These experiences have created foundation in data structures,
which is why I'm now focusing on mastering this area.
